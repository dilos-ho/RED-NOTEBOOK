# RED-NOTEBOOK

This is going to be a git repository of the stuff going on inside my red notebook. For now, I'm trying to develop a 3D rendering system that is capable of designing and producing a building guide for Ikea furniture. These ideas can change and grow overtime but I'm slowly learning the necessary technologies to build such a system, especially on multiple platforms. Ideally, I'd want end-users to be able to search for build guides on a tablet App.

I will try to keep this as up to date as possible but most of the ideas are actually within my own notebook.
