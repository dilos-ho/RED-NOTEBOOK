OKAY HERE'S THE BASIC IDEA:

WE TAKE ANY PRODUCT,

http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/S59009824/

IKEA HAS MANY MANY PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE ASSEMBLY
YET THEY STILL USE PAPER/PDF INSTRUCTION GUIDE WHICH OFTEN
TAKES A WHILE FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIENTATION AND 
ANGLE FOR VIEWING PURPOSES.

BY USING A 3D STEP BY STEP GUIDE, ASSEMBLY BECOMES INFINITELY
EASIER. 

THIS NOT ONLY CREATES JOBS FOR PEOPLE DESIGNING THESE
GUIDES; BY USING A SET PART LIST AND UNIQUE 3D SPACE INTERACTIVITY
TO CREATE A VIRTUAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT.

PRODUCTS ARE IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN AND CAN ROTATE 360
DEGREES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. ZOOM IN AND OUT. ABILITY
TO GO BACK AND FORTH FOR STEPS. HAS ANIMATIONS LIKE:
STUBS GOING IN AND OUT OF THE RESPECTIVE SOCKETS (HOLES).

POSSIBLE: AN INSIDE VIEW IF ZOOMED IN CLOSE ENOUGH.

FOR NOW THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

RESEARCH, RESERACH, RESEARCH

FIRST START WITH:

SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS --> BESIEGE? (THIS GAME SEEMS TO HAVE SIMILAR
ENGINE PHYSICS AND WHAT NOT, CREATION AND WHAT NOT)

GAME ENGINE: UNITY --> RENDERING ENGINE + PHYSICS ENGINE --> RENDERING ENGINE
DEALS WITH THE GRAPHICS (2D OR 3D) WHILE THE PHYSICS ENGINE DEALS WITH HOW 
THINGS WOULD WORK IN THE REAL WORLD.

FIRST: RENDERING ENGINE. 

THIS ESSENTIALLY DRAWS THE SPACE WE NEED TO BEGIN WITH AND I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD 
BE THE STARTING POINT

DEFINITIONS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND: RAY TRACING, 


NOTE: ATM THIS IS A VERY SPECIFIC IDEA, WHCIH IS GOOD FOR WHAT ITS WORTH
I THINK HAVING A REALLY CLEAR PATH IS MUCH MORE LUCRATIVE THAN HAVING A 
VERY GENERAL IDEA. LATER ON, HOWEVER, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THIS 
CAN EXPAND TO MANY OTHER AREAS OF INTEREST. I DONT THINK THAT THERE IS 
ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE ON THE MARKET AND IT SEEMS TO DO A GOOD JOB OF THE 
VERY POPULAR IDEA OF, GIVING PEOPLE JOBS WHILE OFFERING A SERVICE/PRODUCT;
SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED.
